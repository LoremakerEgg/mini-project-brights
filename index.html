            <p>
              Greetings! We are three JavaScript students who have made this
              webpage to show our development and skills that we have acquired
              during our first month of learning JavaScript, HTML and CSS through
              Brights program! We've made this webpage in three days and included
              in the site is this greetings page, a <a href="/team.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> team introductory page </a> and a
              <a href="demo.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demonstration page</a> that shows off more of our direct
              JavaScript knowledge. <br /><br />
              We were inspired by the assignment and demonstration from a previous task, alongside
              Brights own color-scheme and used that as a guideline for how we wanted
              to structure and design our webpage. We've had a very fun time developing this webpage
              and believe our skills and knowledge on how to properly implement our skillset
              into practice and knowing how to make a responsive website has translated well into the 
              webpage you now see, hear and/or touch in front of you.
